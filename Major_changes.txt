#################### Major modification of the package ##########################
## Samuel and Charlotte
## changes are visible in the svn repository RSRevolution 

- naming: thresholdSceptical -> levelSceptical
          minRES -> minRESReplicationSuccess
	  sampleSizeRES -> sampleSizeRESReplicationSuccess

- additions: minRESSignificance
	     sampleSizeRESSignificance

- default: type = "golden" is default everywhere

- modifications in the function: 

before: 
powerReplicationSuccess(zo, c, level = thresholdSceptical(level = 0.05, alternative = alternative, type = "golden"), designPrior, alternative = "one.sided)

						
now: 
powerReplicationSuccess(zo, c, level = 0.025, designPrior, alternative = "one.sided", type = "golden") 


! DANGER: if the old formulation is used with the new function, it will work but the result will be wrong ! 

- same modifications for 
	- sampleSizeReplicationSuccess
	- minRESReplicationSuccess
	- sampleSizeRESReplicationSuccess

- interpretation of "alternative" is less confusing now than before for the functions
  about replication success. We now only have *one* "alternative" in the function.
  But we have to be careful and check it carefully.
  
- changed relative heterogeneity argument name from d to h in powerSignificance and sampleSizeSignificance 

- vignette: 
	- modified accordingly
	- new section (3.4) on relative effect sizes
	- polished references


!! We have to inform the users (in particular Muradchanian)
