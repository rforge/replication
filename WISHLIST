* powerSignificanceInterim: also add the EB shrinkage? -> maybe later
* powerSignificanceInterim: Bounds for power error message? -> I commented this out for the moment, since we anyway return NaN when the limits of uniroot don't have a different sign
* one-sided vs. two-sided, alternative: greater vs. less -> maybe later
* vectorization issues, multiple arguments which don't match in dimensions -> Is implemented now, but still need to decide what to do when dimensions don't match
* include shrinkage and heterogeneity in powerReplicationSuccess sampleReplicationSuccess 
* consistent and short names of studies in data set
* write tests for functions which don't have tests
* option "strict" for two.sided alternative in powerSignificance and sampleSizeSignificance
* Comments from Gosha : page 5 of vignette ; explain more what is meant by "same significance status" 
* Comment from Gosha : how to plan an original study ?
* Comment from Gosha : say that for some plots the code is not provided
* Feedback from tutorial: 
			- Add sample sizes on datasets
			- Put one-sided as default in pSceptical
			- Confusion on terminologies: ratio of variances 
			- Put NaN when the desired power is too large in sampleSizeSignificance instead of error message
* After the tutorial in MÃ¼nich: rethink the variables in dataset. Ideas
			- Only include variables that they need and explain how to obtain the others? 
			- Create a function? 
* After tutorial: vectorization of functions (+ add warnings when power is too large for sampleSizeSignificance)
* names for theta: thetahat, thetao, thetar, thathato, thetahatr ????
