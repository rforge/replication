* powerSignificanceInterim: also add the EB shrinkage? -> maybe later
* powerSignificanceInterim: Bounds for power error message?
* one-sided vs. two-sided, alternative: greater vs. less -> maybe later
* vectorization issues, multiple arguments which don't match in dimensions -> maybe later
* include shrinkage and heterogeneity in powerReplicationSuccess sampleReplicationSuccess 
* consistent and short names of studies in data set
* write tests for functions which don't have tests
* option "strict" for two.sided alternative in powerSignificance and sampleSizeSignificance
* Comments from Gosha : page 5 of vignette ; explain more what is meant by "same significance status" 
* Comment from Gosha : how to plan an original study ?
* Comment from Gosha : say that for some plots the code is not provided
