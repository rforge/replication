\title{Replication probabilities for P-values}
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
\description{
  Computes the probability that a replication study yields an effect
  estimate in the same direction as in the original study. 
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
pReplicate(p=NULL, t=p2t(p, alternative=alternative), c=1, alternative="two.sided")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{p}{
  a vector of P-values, default is \code{NULL}
}
  \item{t}{
  a vector of test statistics. Is calculated from \code{p}, if necessary. 
}
    \item{c}{
      The ratio of the variances of the original and replication effect
      estimates. This is usually the ratio of the sample size of the
      replication study to the sample size of the original study. 
}
  \item{alternative}{either \code{"one.sided"} or \code{"two.sided"}.  Defaults to
          \code{"two.sided"}.  Specifies if the P-value is one-sided or
two-sided.}
}
\details{
  This extends the statistic p_rep
  ("the probability of replicating an effect") by Killeen (2005) to
  the case of possibly unequal sample sizes, see also Senn (2002). 

%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
The probability that a replication study yields an effect
  estimate in the same direction as in the original study.
