\title{Replication probabilities}
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
\description{
  Computes the probability that a replication study yields a significant effect estimate in the specified direction. %in the same direction as in the original study. 
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
powerSignificance(zo, c = 1, level = 0.025, designPrior = "conditional",
                  alternative = "one.sided", d = 0, shrinkage = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{zo}{
    A vector of z-values from original studies. 
  }
  \item{c}{
    The ratio of the variances of the original and replication effect
    estimates. This is usually the ratio of the sample size of the
    replication study to the sample size of the original study. 
  }
  \item{level}{
    Significance level. Default is 0.025.
  }
  \item{designPrior}{
    Either \code{"conditional"}, \code{"predictive"}, or \code{"EB"}.  
    Defaults to \code{"conditional"}. If \code{"EB"}, the power is computed under a predictive distribution where the contribution of the original study is shrunken towards zero based on the evidence in the original study (with an empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator).
  }
  \item{alternative}{
    Either \code{"two.sided"}, \code{"one.sided"}, \code{"less"}, or \code{"greater"}.  
    Specifies direction of the alternative. 
    Defaults to \code{"one.sided"}, the same direction as the original estimate.
  }
  \item{d}{
  The relative between-study heterogeneity, i.e. the ratio of the heterogeneity variance to the variance of the original effect estimate. 
  Default is \code{0} (no heterogeneity).
  Is only taken into account when \code{designPrior = "predictive"} or \code{designPrior = "EB"}.
  } 
  \item{shrinkage}{ 
  Defaults to \code{0}. 
  Specifies how much the original effect estimate is shrunken towards zero (e.g. the effect is shrunken by a factor of 25\% for \code{shrinkage = 0.25}). 
  Is only taken into account when \code{designPrior = "conditional"} or \code{designPrior = "predictive"}.

  \details{
    This extends the 'replication probability', the probability of repeating a statistically significant result by Goodman (1992), to the case of possibly unequal sample sizes (see Senn (2002)), possible between study heterogeneity and shrinkage (see Pawel and Held (2019)).

  }
  \value{
    The probability that a replication study yields a significant effect estimate in the specified direction. An error is returned if it is impossible to obtain the specified power.
