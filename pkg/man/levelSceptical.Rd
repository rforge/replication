\title{Computes the level for the sceptical p-value}

\description{
  The level for the sceptical p-value is computed based on the specified
  alternative and calibration type.
}

\usage{
levelSceptical(level, alternative = "one.sided", type = "golden")
}

\arguments{
\item{level}{
  The required significance level. This can be a vector.
}
\item{alternative}{
    Either \code{"one.sided"} or \code{"two.sided"} or \code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}.  
  Defaults to \code{"one.sided"}. Specifies if the significance level
  is one-sided or two-sided. If the significance level is one-sided, 
  then a one-sided level for the sceptical p-value is computed.
}
\item{type}{
  Type of calibration. Can be either \code{"nominal"}, 
  \code{"liberal"}, \code{"controlled"} or \code{"golden"}.
  Defaults to \code{"golden"}. This type ensures that 
  for an original study just significant at the specified \code{level}, 
  replication success is only possible if the replication effect estimate 
  larger than the original one.
  If \code{"type"} is \code{"controlled"} then the type-I error rate is equal
  to \code{level}^2 (for alternative = "two.sided") or 
  2 \eqn{\times}{*}\code{level}^2 (for alternative = "one.sided") if the 
  variance ratio is equal to 1. 
  The type \code{"nominal"} ensures that the type-I error rate is always smaller 
  than \code{level}^2. Significance of both the original and replication study 
  at \code{level} is then a necessary but not sufficient requirement for 
  replication success. 
  If \code{"type"} is \code{"liberal"} then significance of both studies is a 
  sufficient requirement for replication success if the variance ratio is equal 
  to 1.
