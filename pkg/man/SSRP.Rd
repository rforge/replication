\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the __description__ above ~~
  Two-sided P-values were calculated assuming normality of Fisher-z transformed effect estimates.
  A two-stage procedure was used for the replications. In stage 1, the authors had 90\% power to detect 75\% of the original effect size at the 5\% significance level in a two-sided test. If the original result replicated in stage 1 (two-sided P-value < 0.05 and effect in the same direction as in the original study), the data collection was stopped. If not, a second data collection was carried out in stage 2 to have 90\% power to detect 50\% of the original effect size for the first and the second data collections pooled. \code{n75} and \code{n50} are the planned sample sizes calculated to reach 90\% power in stage 1 and 2, respectively. They sometimes differ from the sample sizes that were actually collected (\code{n_I} and \code{n_R}, respectively). See supplementary information of Camerer et al. (2018) for details.
