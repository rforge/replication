Structure: 

1. Intro: general concepts 
	- Replication studies / Projects 
	- Significance vs Precision vs Reverse-Bayes 
	- Inflation/shrinkage/heterogeneity
	- Mention normality assumption 
	- Conditional vs predictive power

2. Hand-on
- PowerSignificance() - sampleSizeSignificanceInterim()
   Application 
	1. Recycle exercises from Reproducibility Day and Scientifica
	2. Application using the four replication projects

- sampleSizePI() 

- PowerReplicationSuccess() - sampleSizeReplicationSuccess() 

3. Outlook: Interim analyses (if time permits)
